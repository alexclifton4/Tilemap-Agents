        <p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move around, and space to place a box. A worker will come and pick up the box.</p>
        <h3>Task system</h3>
        <p>Many management simulations games have a mechanic where workers carry out tasks, for example the contruction workers in Prison Architect, and I wanted to implement something like this.</p>
        <p>
          There is a task system which workers can register with, and that tasks can be added to.
          When a task is created, it will immediately be assigned to a worker if one is available, otherwise it will be added to a queue.
          Likewise, workers will be given waiting tasks when they register, or added to a queue if there are no current tasks.
        </p>
        <p>Using queues for both the workers and tasks is a fairly basic approach and I would like to improve this to work out which task and worker are closest to each other.</p>
        <p>The workers use Breadth-first search to find their target. Something like A* would be more efficient for this, but it doesn't affect performance in this demo.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The demo is made in C++ using SDL for graphics. This is the first time I've used Emscripten to compile C++ for the web, and I also managed to port it to Android.</p>
        <p>The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/alexclifton4/tilemap-agents">on GitHub</a>.</p>
